# ${1:Stream.it}
IRC controlled chatroom that can plays games through defined commands from your phone or users can just chat together live while watching people frustratingly try to control the game.
## Installation
To install the application you need to clone the repo. and run `npm i --save` to install all the dependencies.
## Usage
To use the app you need the following programs:
1. An Emulator to run the game from (ZSNES, GBA, Dolphin, ETC.) ZSNES: https://www.fosshub.com/ZSNES.html
2. A way to stream the game (only the host needs this to stream the game) OBS: https://obsproject.com/ to capture the game and http://Twitch.tv to relay the stream.
3. An IRC client app on your phone, pc or mac to connect to the chatroom and relay commands. I recommend AndroIRC for Android, TurboIRC for iphone, MIRC for windows and LimeIRC for Mac.
4. Friends! This is a lot of fun with a group of people because it's a way of controlling the game one command at a time so you either work with your friends to beat the game or work against your friends because that's just more fun.
## Contributing
My goal is to break this down into an app that can run without any external software. which is surprisingly difficult. Also, this doesn't work on Windows because it utilizes Python to convert keystrokes. (windows doesn't have Python (boo!) because they utilize their own languages to accomplish what Python does for Mac and Linux).
\n 1. Fork it!
\n 2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
\n 3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
\n 4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
\n 5. Submit a pull request :D
